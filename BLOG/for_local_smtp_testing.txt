RUN: 

python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025

this will make a loacal smtp server on which you can check the email sent 
from django

however, there is one thing to notice, django's reset password works only
iff the email is actually associated with any user in the user table
otherwise it won't work, but it will show the password_reset_dont still.

won't work :
if the email is not associated with any account
if the email entered is wrong
